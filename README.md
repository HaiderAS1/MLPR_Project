# MLPR_Project

From artistic drawing to fraud detection deep neural
 networks have been immensely successful in most of the learning
 fields. In this project paper, we exploit neural style transfer
 which is a deep network based algorithm to achieve artistic
 style in any desired image keeping the contents similar. Classical
 statistic based methods as well as current Deep network based
 methods are discussed here with their relative pros and cons. As a
 mother paper we implement and discuss in details abput ”Image
 Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks, Gatys et.
 al. CVPR 2016” as this paper captures the central theme of deep
 network based style transfer algorithms and new algorithms are
 mostly tweaks of ideas presented in that paper
